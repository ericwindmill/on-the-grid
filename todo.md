Properties to manipulate:
  * minmax?
  * auto-fill / auto-fit?
  * align / justify content? 
 
Ideas:
  * Make 'info' on main page reasonable 
  * Make info on tutorial page better
  * add 'goal layout' to tutorial
  * style window like browser
  * style turtoial index items like actual browser things.
  
Bugs:
  * blocks expand past grid if you type in too much text.
    * this could be a feature: watch out! too much text will break the grid!
  * Handle resizing of the grid overlay
  * footer has more options for success than others?
