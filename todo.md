Properties to manipulate:
  * minmax?
  * auto-fill / auto-fit?
  * align / justify content? 
 
Ideas:
  * make an overlay for main thing
    * this wouldn't be too hard. Just make an overlay that 
      updates the same way as the normal grid.
  * style turtoial index items like actual browser things.
  * style window like browser
  
Bugs:
  * blocks expand past grid if you type in too much text.
  * all 'enters' should be leave-focus or whatever
  * new grid items need to be content editable.
  * Handle resizing of the grid overlay
