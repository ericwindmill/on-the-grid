Properties to manipulate:
  * minmax?
  * auto-fill / auto-fit?

  
Bugs:
  * blocks expand past grid if you type in too much text.
    * this could be a feature: watch out! too much text will break the grid!

  Add a 'tips' modal that gives all sorts of insigts:
   * The 'bug' above
   * why justify / align don't always act in the way you'd expect.
   * etc.


  Lessons:
  1. moving items
  2. overlay
  3. justification and alignment
